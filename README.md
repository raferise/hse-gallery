# HSE Gallery - It's a gallery, people
## Requirements to upload images
You need:
* Python (lots of versions should work I think, I used 3.8)
* PIL (Python Imaging Library) - This is used in thumb.py to generate compressed images
## How to upload files
Create an 'upload' folder in the main directory. Put images in it. Run upload.bat
