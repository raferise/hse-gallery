# [HSE Gallery](https://infinitymeme.github.io/hse-gallery)
This project was created by request from my application development teacher to show off student graduation photos. Mostly just a technical test at this point, since the code style is old and not very well organized.
## Requirements to upload images
You need:
* Python (lots of versions should work I think, I used 3.8)
* Pillow (PIL) - This is used in thumbs.py to generate compressed images
## How to upload files
Create an `upload` folder in the main directory. Put images in it. Run upload.bat
